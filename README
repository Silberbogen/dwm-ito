dwm-ito - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm-ito is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm-ito you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm-ito is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm-ito (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running dwm-ito
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm-ito using startx:

    exec dwm-ito

In order to connect dwm-ito to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm-ito

(This will start dwm-ito on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm-ito


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm-ito is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
